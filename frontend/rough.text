-Product listing is done on json server. 
-Cart isnt maintained on server but is rather maintained in redux in-memory state.

 Bug in checkout page which when 1 items quantity is increased rather 
  increases quantity of all the items.

-Duplicate items also get added to cart
-Checkout is just input boxes without checks 
  and also just alert order placed message, 
  no order details data is maintained.

-Bugs in filter and sort

-Generally speaking, Redux/Redux thunk 
  and JSON server should work together. 
  
-The flow should be you making network requests ( GET/POST ) , 
  after response from server, redux along with thunk should 
  update applicationâ€™s state accordingly

-Redux with thunk is still not implemented 
  and no chages has been done as asked in the feedback - Abdul - May 19
